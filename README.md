## Objective
The objective of this project is to assess and compare the performance of different AI models by using standard evaluation metrics, enabling informed decisions for model selection in AI applications.

## Key Activities
### Model Implementation
- Implementing multiple AI models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Training these models using the provided dataset.

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluating models using common metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
- Comparing the performance of different models to identify the most effective one.

### Result Compilation
- Storing and displaying the results in an organized manner for review and comparison.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language for building and evaluating models.
- **pandas:** Used for data manipulation.
- **scikit-learn:** Employed for model implementation and evaluation metrics.
- **numpy:** Utilized for numerical operations.

## Key Insights
### Model Performance
- Each model's performance metrics are calculated and compared.
- The best-performing model is identified based on the evaluation criteria.

### Comparative Analysis
- The comparison provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
- Helps determine which model is best suited for the given problem.

## Usage
### Steps to Run the Model Evaluation Script:
1. **Load Dataset:**
   - Ensure the dataset is in CSV format and loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Preprocess Data:**
   - Split the data into features (X) and target (y).
3. **Train and Evaluate Models:**
   - Use the script to train and evaluate multiple models.
4. **View Results:**
   - The script prints the evaluation metrics for each model, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

### Sample Installation and Setup
Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```
Run the model evaluation script in your Python environment.
